**GraphQL Server for Laravel**

Lighthouse is a PHP package that allows you to serve a GraphQL endpoint from your
Laravel application. It greatly reduces the boilerplate required to create a schema,
it integrates well with any Laravel project, and it's highly customizable
giving you full control over your data.

## [Documentation](https://lighthouse-php.netlify.com/)

The documentation for Lighthouse is maintained in a seperate repository: https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse-docs

## Get started

If you have an existing Laravel project, all you really need is two steps:

1. Install via `composer require nuwave/lighthouse`

2. Define your schema in `routes/graphql/schema.graphql`

## Get involved

We welcome contributions of any kind.
