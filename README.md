**GraphQL Server for Laravel**

</div>

Lighthouse is a PHP package that allows you to serve a GraphQL endpoint from your
Laravel application. It greatly reduces the boilerplate required to create a schema,
it integrates well with any Laravel project, and it's highly customizable
giving you full control over your data.

## [Documentation](https://lighthouse-php.com/)

The documentation lives at [lighthouse-php.com](https://lighthouse-php.com/).

A chinese translation is available at [lighthouse-php.cn](http://lighthouse-php.cn/) and is maintained
over at https://github.com/haxibiao/lighthouse

You can find the markdown source files in [/docs](/docs).

## Get started

If you have an existing Laravel project, all you really need
to get up and running is a few steps:

1. Install via `composer require nuwave/lighthouse`
2. Publish the default schema `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nuwave\Lighthouse\LighthouseServiceProvider" --tag=schema`
3. Use something like [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/mll-lab/laravel-graphql-playground) to explore your GraphQL endpoint

Check out [the docs](https://lighthouse-php.com/) to learn more.
