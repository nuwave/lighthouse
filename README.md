**A framework for serving GraphQL from Laravel**

</div>

Lighthouse is a GraphQL framework that integrates with your Laravel application.
It takes the best ideas of both and combines them to solve common tasks with ease
and offer flexibility when you need it.

## Documentation

The documentation lives at [lighthouse-php.com](https://lighthouse-php.com/).

The site includes the latest docs for each major version of Lighthouse.
You can find docs for specific versions by looking at the contents of [/docs/master](/docs/master)
at that point in the git history: `https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse/tree/<SPECIFIC-TAG>/docs/master`.

A chinese translation is available at [lighthouse-php.cn](http://lighthouse-php.cn/) and is maintained
