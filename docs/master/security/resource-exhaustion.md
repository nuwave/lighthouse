# Resource Exhaustion

GraphQL gives enormous power to clients.
With great power there must also come great responsibility ðŸ•·.

Since clients have the possibility to craft very complex queries, we must be ready
to handle them properly. These queries may be abusive queries from evil clients,
or may simply be very large queries used by legitimate clients.
In both of these cases, the client can potentially take your GraphQL server down.

You can utilize the built-in security options through `config/lighthouse.php`.
