# Authentication

You can use [standard Laravel mechanisms](https://laravel.com/docs/authentication)
to authenticate users of your GraphQL API.

## AttemptAuthentication middleware

As all GraphQL requests are served at a single HTTP endpoint, middleware added
through the `lighthouse.php` config will run for all queries against your server.

In most cases, your schema will have some publicly accessible fields and others
that require authentication. As multiple checks for authentication or permissions may be
required in a single request, it is convenient to attempt authentication once per request.

```php
    'route' => [
        'middleware' => [
            \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\AttemptAuthentication::class,
        ],
    ],
```

Note that the `AttemptAuthentication` middleware does _not_ protect your fields from unauthenticated
access, decorate them with [@guard](../api-reference/directives.md#guard) as needed.

If you want to guard all your fields against unauthenticated access, you can simply add
Laravel's build-in auth middleware. Beware that this approach does not allow any GraphQL
operations for guest users, so you will have to handle login outside of GraphQL.

```php
'middleware' => [
    'auth:api',
],
```

## Configure the guard

You can configure a default guard to use for authenticating GraphQL requests in `lighthouse.php`.

```php
    'guard' => 'api',
```

This setting is used whenever Lighthouse looks for an authenticated user, for example in directives
such as [@guard](../api-reference/directives.md#guard), or when applying the `AttempAuthentication` middleware.

Stateless guards are recommended for most use cases, such as the default `api` guard.
If you are using [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/master/sanctum) for your API, set it here:

```php
    'guard' => 'sanctum',
```

## Guard selected fields

If you want to guard only selected fields, you can use the [@guard](../api-reference/directives.md#guard)
directive to require authentication for accessing them.

```graphql
type Query {
  profile: User! @guard
}
```

If you need to guard multiple fields, just use [@guard](../api-reference/directives.md#guard)
on a `type` or an `extend type` definition. It will be applied to all fields within that type.

```graphql
extend type Query @guard
  adminInfo: Secrets
  nukeCodes: [NukeCode!]!
}
```

## Get the current user

Lighthouse provides a really simple way to fetch the information of the currently authenticated user.
Just add a field that returns your `User` type and decorate it with the [@auth](../api-reference/directives.md#auth) directive.

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User @auth
}
```

Sending the following query will return the authenticated user's info
or `null` if the request is not authenticated.

```graphql
{
  me {
    name
    email
  }
}
```
