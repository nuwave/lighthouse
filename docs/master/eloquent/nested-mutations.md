# Nested Mutations

Lighthouse allows you to create, update or delete models and their associated relationships
all in one single mutation. This is enabled by the [nested arg resolvers mechanism](../concepts/arg-resolvers.md).

## Return Types Required

You have to define return types on your relationship methods so that Lighthouse
can detect them.

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;

class Post extends Model 
{
    // WORKS
    public function user(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }

    // DOES NOT WORK
    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}
```

## Partial Failure

By default, all mutations are wrapped in a database transaction.
If any of the nested operations fail, the whole mutation is aborted
and no changes are written to the database.

You can change this setting [in the configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md).

## Belongs To

We will start of by defining a mutation to create a post.

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createPost(input: CreatePostInput! @spread): Post @create
}
```

The mutation takes a single argument `input` that contains data about
the Post you want to create.

```graphql
input CreatePostInput {
  title: String!
  author: CreateUserBelongsTo
}
```

The first argument `title` is a value of the `Post` itself and corresponds
to a column in the database.

The second argument `author` is named just like the relationship method that is defined on the `Post` model.
A nested `BelongsTo` relationship exposes the following operations:

- `connect` it to an existing model
- `create` a new related model and attach it
- `update` an existing model and attach it
- `upsert` a new or an existing model and attach it
- `diconnect` the related model
- `delete` the related model and the association to it

Both `disconnect` and `delete` don't make much sense in the context of an update.
You can control what operations are possible by defining just what you need in the `input`.
We choose to expose the following operations on the related `User` model:

```graphql
input CreateUserBelongsTo {
  connect: ID
  create: CreateUserInput
  update: UpdateUserInput
  upsert: UpsertUserInput
}
```

Finally, you need to define the input that allows you to create a new `User`.

```graphql
input CreateUserInput {
  name: String!
}
```

To create a new model and connect it to an existing model,
just pass the ID of the model you want to associate.

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(input: {
    title: "My new Post"
    author: {
      connect: 123
    }
  }){
    id
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Lighthouse will create a new `Post` and associate an `User` with it.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createPost": {
      "id": 456,
      "author": {
        "name": "Herbert"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If the related model does not exist yet, you can also
create a new one.

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(input: {
    title: "My new Post"
    author: {
      create: {
        name: "Gina"
      }  
    }
  }){
    id
    author {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createPost": {
      "id": 456,
      "author": {
        "id": 55
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When issuing an update, you can also allow the user to remove a relation.
Both `disconnect` and `delete` remove the association to the author,
but `delete` also removes the author model itself.

```graphql
type Mutation {
  updatePost(input: UpdatePostInput! @spread): Post @update
}

input UpdatePostInput {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  author: UpdateUserBelongsTo
}

input UpdateUserBelongsTo {
  connect: ID
  create: CreateUserInput
  update: UpdateUserInput
  upsert: UpdateUserInput
  disconnect: Boolean
  delete: Boolean
}
```

You must pass a truthy value to `disconnect` and `delete` for them to actually run.
This structure was chosen as it is consistent with updating `BelongsToMany` relationships
and allows the query string to be mostly static, taking a variable value to control its behaviour.

```graphql
mutation UpdatePost($disconnectAuthor: Boolean){
  updatePost(input: {
    id: 1
    title: "An updated title"
    author: {
      disconnect: $disconnectAuthor
    }
  }){
    title
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The `author` relationship will only be disconnected if the value of the variable
`$disconnectAuthor` is `true`, if `false` or `null` are passed, it will not change.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "updatePost": {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "An updated title",
      "author": null
    }
  }
}
```

When issuing an `upsert`, you may expose the same nested operations as an `update`.
In case a new model is created, they will simply be ignored.

```graphql
mutation UpdatePost($disconnectAuthor: Boolean){
  upsertPost(input: {
    id: 1
    title: "An updated or created title"
    author: {
      disconnect: $disconnectAuthor
    }
  }){
    id
    title
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "upsertPost": {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "An updated or created title",
      "author": null
    }
  }
}
```

## Has Many

The counterpart to a `BelongsTo` relationship is `HasMany`. We will start
off by defining a mutation to create an `User`.

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createUser(input: CreateUserInput! @spread): User @create
}
```

This mutation takes a single argument `input` that contains values
of the `User` itself and its associated `Post` models.

```graphql
input CreateUserInput {
  name: String!
  posts: CreatePostsHasMany
}
```

Now, we can expose an operation that allows us to directly create new posts
right when we create the `User`.

```graphql
input CreatePostsHasMany {
  create: [CreatePostInput!]!
}

input CreatePostInput {
  title: String!
}
```

We can now create a `User` and some posts with it in one request.

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: {
    name: "Phil"
    posts: {
      create: [
        {
          title: "Phils first post"
        },
        {
          title: "Awesome second post"
        }
      ]  
    }
  }){
    id
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createUser": {
      "id": 23,
      "posts": [
        {
          "id": 434
        },
        {
          "id": 435
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

When updating a `User`, further nested operations become possible.
It is up to you which ones you want to expose through the schema definition.

The following example covers the full range of possible operations:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  updateUser(input: UpdateUserInput! @spread): User @update
}

input UpdateUserInput {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  posts: UpdatePostsHasMany
}

input UpdatePostsHasMany {
  create: [CreatePostInput!]
  update: [UpdatePostInput!]
  upsert: [UpsertPostInput!]
  delete: [ID!]
}

input CreatePostInput {
  title: String!
}

input UpdatePostInput {
  id: ID!
  title: String
}

input UpsertPostInput {
  id: ID!
  title: String
}
```

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(input: {
    id: 3,
    name: "Phillip"
    posts: {
      create: [
        {
          title: "A new post"
        }
      ],
      update: [
        {
          id: 45,
          title: "This post is updated"
        }
      ],
      delete: [
        8,
      ]
    }
  }){
    id
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

The behaviour for `upsert` is a mix between updating and creating,
it will produce the needed action regardless of whether the model exists or not.

## Belongs To Many

A belongs to many relation allows you to create new related models as well
as attaching existing ones.

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createPost(input: CreatePostInput! @spread): Post @create
}

input CreatePostInput {
  title: String!
  authors: CreateAuthorBelongsToMany
}

input CreateAuthorBelongsToMany {
  create: [CreateAuthorInput!]
  upsert: [UpsertAuthorInput!]
  connect: [ID!]
  sync: [ID!]
}

input CreateAuthorInput {
  name: String!
}

input UpsertAuthorInput {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

Just pass the ID of the models you want to associate or their full information
to create a new relation.

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(input: {
    title: "My new Post"
    authors: {
      create: [
        {
          name: "Herbert"
        }
      ]
      upsert: [
        {
          id: 2000
          name: "Newton"
        }
      ]
      connect: [
        123
      ]
    }
  }){
    id
    authors {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Lighthouse will detect the relationship and attach, update or create it.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createPost": {
      "id": 456,
      "authors": [
        {
          "id": 165,
          "name": "Herbert"
        },
        {
          "id": 2000,
          "name": "Newton"
        },
        {
          "id": 123,
          "name": "Franz"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

It is also possible to use the `sync` operation to ensure only the given IDs
will be contained withing the relation.

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(input: {
    title: "My new Post"
    authors: {
      sync: [
        123
      ]
    }
  }){
    id
    authors {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Updates on `BelongsToMany` relations may expose additional nested operations:

```graphql
input UpdateAuthorBelongsToMany {
  create: [CreateAuthorInput!]
  connect: [ID!]
  update: [UpdateAuthorInput!]
  upsert: [UpsertAuthorInput!]
  sync: [ID!]
  syncWithoutDetaching: [ID!]
  delete: [ID!]
  disconnect: [ID!]
}
```

### Storing Pivot Data

It is common that many-to-many relations store some extra data in pivot tables.
Suppose we want to track what movies a user has seen. In addition to connecting
the two entities, we want to store how well they liked it:

```graphql
type User {
    id: ID!
    seenMovies: [Movie!] @belongsToMany
}

type Movie {
    id: ID!
    pivot: UserMoviePivot
}

type UserMoviePivot {
    "How well did the user like the movie?"
    rating: String
}
```

Laravel's `sync()`, `syncWithoutDetach()` or `connect()` methods allow you to pass
an array where the keys are IDs of related models and the values are pivot data.

Lighthouse exposes this capability through the nested operations on many-to-many relations.
Instead of passing just a list of ids, you can define an `input` type that also contains pivot data.
It must contain a field called `id` to contain the ID of the related model,
all other fields will be inserted into the pivot table.

```graphql
type Mutation {
    updateUser(input: UpdateUserInput! @spread): User @update
}

input UpdateUserInput {
    id: ID!
    seenMovies: UpdateUserSeenMovies
}

input UpdateUserSeenMovies {
    connect: [ConnectUserSeenMovie!]
}

input ConnectUserSeenMovie {
    id: ID!
    rating: String
}
```

You can now pass along pivot data when connecting users to movies:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(input: {
    id: 1
    seenMovies: {
      connect: [
        {
          id: 6
          rating: "A perfect 5/7"
        }
        {
          id: 23
        }
      ]
    },
  }) {
    id
    seenMovies {
      id
      pivot {
        rating
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And you will get the following response: 

```json
{
  "data": {
    "updateUser": {
      "id": 1,
      "seenMovies": [
        {
          "id": 6,
          "pivot": {
            "rating": "A perfect 5/7"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": 20,
          "pivot": {
            "rating": null
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

It is also possible to use the `sync` and `syncWithoutDetach` operations.

## MorphTo

__The GraphQL Specification does not support Input Union types,
for now we are limiting this implementation to `connect`, `disconnect` and `delete` operations.
See https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse/issues/900 for further discussion.__

```graphql
type Task {
  id: ID
  name: String
}

type Hour {
  id: ID
  weekday: Int
  hourable: Task
}

type Mutation {
  createHour(input: CreateHourInput! @spread): Hour @create
  updateHour(input: UpdateHourInput! @spread): Hour @update
  upsertHour(input: UpsertHourInput! @spread): Hour @upsert
}

input CreateHourInput {
  from: String
  to: String
  weekday: Int
  hourable: CreateHourableMorphTo
}

input UpdateHourInput {
  id: ID!
  from: String
  to: String
  weekday: Int
  hourable: UpdateHourableMorphTo
}

input UpsertHourInput {
  id: ID!
  from: String
  to: String
  weekday: Int
  hourable: UpsertHourableMorphTo
}

input CreateHourableMorphTo {
  connect: ConnectHourableInput
}

input UpdateHourableMorphTo {
  connect: ConnectHourableInput
  disconnect: Boolean
  delete: Boolean
}

input UpsertHourableMorphTo {
  connect: ConnectHourableInput
  disconnect: Boolean
  delete: Boolean
}

input ConnectHourableInput {
  type: String!
  id: ID!
}
```

You can use `connect` to associate existing models.

```graphql
mutation {
  createHour(input: {
    weekday: 2
    hourable: {
      connect: {
        type: "App\\Models\\Task"
        id: 1
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
    weekday
    hourable {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The `disconnect` operations allows you to detach the currently associated model.

```graphql
mutation {
  updateHour(input: {
    id: 1
    weekday: 2
    hourable: {
      disconnect: true
    }
  }) {
    weekday
    hourable {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The `delete` operation both detaches and deletes the currently associated model.

```graphql
mutation {
  upsertHour(input: {
    id: 1
    weekday: 2
    hourable: {
      delete: true
    }
  }) {
    weekday
    hourable {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Morph To Many

A morph to many relation allows you to create new related models as well
as attaching existing ones.

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createTask(input: CreateTaskInput! @spread): Task @create
}

input CreateTaskInput {
  name: String!
  tags: CreateTagMorphToMany
}

input CreateTagMorphToMany {
  create: [CreateTagInput!]
  upsert: [UpsertTagInput!]
  sync: [ID!]
  connect: [ID!]
}

input CreateTagInput {
  name: String!
}

input UpsertTagInput {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}


type Task {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  tags: [Tag!]!
}

type Tag {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

In this example, the tag with id `1` already exists in the database. The query connects this tag to the task using the `MorphToMany` relationship.
 
```graphql
mutation {
  createTask(input: {
    name: "Loundry"
    tags: {
      connect: [1]
    }
  }) {
    tags {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

You can either use `connect` or `sync` during creation. 

When you want to create a new tag while creating the task,
you need to use the `create` operation to provide an array of `CreateTagInput` 
or use the `upsert` operation to provide an array of `UpsertTagInput`:

```graphql
mutation {
  createTask(input: {
    name: "Loundry"
      tags: {
        create: [
          {
            name: "home"
          }
        ]
      }
  }) {
    tags {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
