# Types

A GraphQL schema is made out of types. This section describes the different set of types
and how they can be defined to work with Lighthouse. For a more in-depth reference about types,
look into the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/)

## Object Type

Object types define the resources of your API and are closely related to Eloquent models.
They must have a unique name and contain a set of fields.

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  created_at: String!
  updated_at: String
}

type Query {
  users: [User!]!
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

## Scalar

Scalar types are the most basic elements of a GraphQL schema. There are a
few built in scalars, such as `String` or `Int`.

Lighthouse provides some scalars that work well with Laravel out of the box,
read about them in the [API reference for scalars](../api-reference/scalars.md).

Define your own scalar types by running `php artisan lighthouse:scalar <Scalar name>`
and including it in your schema. Lighthouse will look for Scalar types in a configurable
default namespace.

```graphql
scalar ZipCode

type User {
  zipCode: ZipCode
}
```

You can also use third-party scalars, such as those provided by [mll-lab/graphql-php-scalars](https://github.com/mll-lab/graphql-php-scalars).
Just `composer require` your package of choice and add a scalar definition to your schema.
Use the [@scalar](../api-reference/directives.md#scalar) directive to point to any fully qualified class name:

```graphql
scalar Email @scalar(class: "MLL\\GraphQLScalars\\Email")
```

## Enum

Enums are types with a restricted set of values (similar to `enum` found in database migrations).
They are defined as a list of `UPPERCASE` string keys.

### Schema definition

You can define the actual values through the [@enum](../api-reference/directives.md#enum) directive.

```graphql
enum EmploymentStatus {
  INTERN @enum(value: 0)
  EMPLOYEE @enum(value: 1)
  TERMINATED @enum(value: 2)
}
```

Now we can use the enum as part of our schema.

```graphql
type Employee {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  status: EmploymentStatus!
}

type Query {
  employees: [Employee!]! @all
}
```

In this example, the underlying values are actually integers. When the models are retrieved from
the database, the mapping is applied and the integers are converted to the defined string keys.

```php
return [
  ['name' => 'Hans', 'status' => 0],
  ['name' => 'Pamela', 'status' => 1],
  ['name' => 'Gerhard', 'status' => 2],
];
```

Queries now return meaningful names instead of magic numbers.

```graphql
{
  employees {
    name
    status
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "employees": [
      { "name": "Hans", "status": "INTERN" },
      { "name": "Pamela", "status": "EMPLOYEE" },
      { "name": "Gerhard", "status": "TERMINATED" }
    ]
  }
}
```

If the internal value of the enum is the same as the field name, [@enum](../api-reference/directives.md#enum) can be omitted:

```graphql
enum Role {
  ADMIN
}
```

The PHP internal value of the field `ADMIN` will be `string('ADMIN')`.

### Native PHP definition

If you want to reuse enum definitions or constants from PHP, you can also
register a native PHP enum type [through the TypeRegistry](../digging-deeper/adding-types-programmatically.md#native-php-types).

Just define a [EnumType](http://webonyx.github.io/graphql-php/type-system/enum-types/) and
register it:

```php
use GraphQL\Type\Definition\EnumType;
use Nuwave\Lighthouse\Schema\TypeRegistry;

$episodeEnum = new EnumType([
    'name' => 'Episode',
    'description' => 'One of the films in the Star Wars Trilogy',
    'values' => [
        'NEWHOPE' => [
            'value' => 4,
            'description' => 'Released in 1977.'
        ],
        'EMPIRE' => [
            'value' => 5,
            'description' => 'Released in 1980.'
        ],
        'JEDI' => [
            'value' => 6,
            'description' => 'Released in 1983.'
        ],
    ]
]);

// Resolve this through the container, as it is a singleton
$typeRegistry = app(TypeRegistry::class);

$typeRegistry->register($episodeEnum);
```

If you are using [BenSampo/laravel-enum](https://github.com/BenSampo/laravel-enum)
you can use `Nuwave\Lighthouse\Schema\Types\LaravelEnumType` to construct an enum type from it.

Given the following enum:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Enums;

use BenSampo\Enum\Enum;

final class UserType extends Enum
{
    public const Administrator = 0;
    public const Moderator = 1;
    public const Subscriber = 2;
    public const SuperAdministrator = 3;
}
```

This is how you can register it in a ServiceProvider. Make sure to wrap it
in a `LaravelEnumType`.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\GraphQL;

use App\Enums\UserType;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Nuwave\Lighthouse\Schema\TypeRegistry;
use Nuwave\Lighthouse\Schema\Types\LaravelEnumType;

class GraphQLServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     *
     * @param  \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Schema\TypeRegistry  $typeRegistry
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot(TypeRegistry $typeRegistry): void
    {
        $typeRegistry->register(
             new LaravelEnumType(UserType::class)
        );
    }
}
```

By default, the generated type will be named just like the given class.

```php
$enum = new LaravelEnumType(UserType::class);
var_dump($enum->name); // UserType
```

You may overwrite the name if the default does not fit or you have a name conflict.

```php
$enum = new LaravelEnumType(UserType::class, 'UserKind');
var_dump($enum->name); // UserKind
```

## Input

Input types can be used to describe complex objects for field arguments.
Beware that while they look similar to Object Types, they behave differently:
The fields of an Input Type are treated similar to arguments.

```graphql
input CreateUserInput {
  name: String!
  email: String
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(input: CreateUserInput! @spread): User @create
}
```

## Interface

The GraphQL `interface` type is similar to a PHP `Interface`.
It defines a set of common fields that all implementing types must also provide.
A common use-case for interfaces with a Laravel project would be polymorphic relationships.

```graphql
interface Named {
  name: String!
}
```

Object types can implement that interface, given that they provide all its fields.

```graphql
type User implements Named {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

The following definition would be invalid.

```graphql
type User implements Named {
  id: ID!
}
```

Interfaces need a way of determining which concrete Object Type is returned by a
particular query. Lighthouse provides a default type resolver that works by calling
`class_basename($value)` on the value returned by the resolver.

You can also provide a custom type resolver. Run `php artisan lighthouse:interface <Interface name>` to create
a custom interface class. It is automatically put in the default namespace where Lighthouse can discover it by itself.

Read more about them in the [GraphQL Reference](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces) and the
[docs for graphql-php](http://webonyx.github.io/graphql-php/type-system/interfaces/)

## Union

A Union is an abstract type that simply enumerates other Object Types.
They are similar to interfaces in that they can return different types, but they can not
have fields defined.

```graphql
union Person = User | Employee

type User {
  id: ID!
}

type Employee {
  employeeId: ID!
}
```

Just like Interfaces, you need a way to determine the concrete Object Type for a Union,
based on the resolved value. If the default type resolver does not work for you, define your
own using `php artisan lighthouse:union <Union name>`.
It is automatically put in the default namespace where Lighthouse can discover it by itself.

Read more about them in the [GraphQL Reference](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#union-types) and the
[docs for graphql-php](http://webonyx.github.io/graphql-php/type-system/unions/)
