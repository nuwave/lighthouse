# Feature Toggles

Lighthouse allows you to conditionally show or hide elements of your schema.

## @show and @hide

The directives [@show](../api-reference/directives.md#show) and [@hide](../api-reference/directives.md#hide)
work in a similar way, but are logical opposites of each other.

For example, you might want to limit an experimental new field to test environments.
[@show](../api-reference/directives.md#show) is most suitable for this:

```graphql
type Query {
  testInformation: String! @show(env: ["integration", "staging"])
}
```

Another example would be a field that should be available in every environment but production.
In this case, [@hide](../api-reference/directives.md#hide) fits better:

```graphql
type Query {
  debugInformation: String! @hide(env: ["production"])
}
```

## @feature

The [@feature](../api-reference/directives.md#feature) directive allows to include fields in the schema depending
on a [Laravel Pennant](https://laravel.com/docs/pennant) feature.

For example, you might want a new experimental field only to be available when the according feature is active:

```graphql
type Query {
  experimentalField: String! @feature(name: "new-api")
}
```

In this case, `experimentalField` will only be included when the `new-api` feature is active.

Another example would be to only include a field when the feature is inactive:

```graphql
type Query {
  deprecatedField: String! @feature(name: "new-api", when: "INACTIVE")
}
```

When using [class based features](https://laravel.com/docs/pennant#class-based-features),
the fully qualified class name must be used as the value for the `name` argument:

```graphql
type Query {
  experimentalField: String! @feature(name: "App\\Features\\NewApi")
}
```

## Interaction With Schema Cache

[@show](../api-reference/directives.md#show) and [@hide](../api-reference/directives.md#hide) work by manipulating the schema.
This means that when using their `env` option, the inclusion or exclusion of elements depends on the value
of `app()->environment()` at the time the schema is built and not update on later environment changes.
If you are pre-generating your schema cache, make sure to match the environment to your deployment target.

The same goes for [@feature](../api-reference/directives.md#feature). Whether a field is included in the schema will be
based on the state of a feature at the time the schema is built. In addition, if you are pre-generating your schema cache,
you will only be able to use features that support [nullable scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/pennant#nullable-scope),
as there won't be an authenticated user to check the feature against.
