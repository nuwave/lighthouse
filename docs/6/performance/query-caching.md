# Query caching

In order to speed up GraphQL query parsing, the parsed queries can be stored in the Laravel cache.

Query caching is enabled by default. You can define cache store and cache duration, see `config/lighthouse.php`.

Make sure you flush the query cache when you deploy an upgraded version of the `webonyx/graphql-php` dependency:

    php artisan cache:clear

## Automated Persisted Queries

Lighthouse supports Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ), compatible with the
[Apollo implementation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq).

APQ is enabled by default, but depends on query caching being enabled.

## Query validation caching

Lighthouse can cache the result of the query validation process as well. It only caches queries without errors.
`QueryComplexity` validation can not be cached as it is dependent on the query, so it is always executed.

Query validation caching is disabled by default. You can enable it by setting `validation_cache.enable` to `true` in the
configuration in `config/lighthouse.php`.

## Testing caveats

If you are mocking Laravel cache classes like `\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache` or `\Illuminate\Cache\Repository` and asserting expectations in your unit tests, it might be best to disable the query cache in your `phpunit.xml`:

```diff
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <phpunit ...>
      ...
      <php>
+         <server name="LIGHTHOUSE_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLE" value="false" />
      </php>
  </phpunit>
```
