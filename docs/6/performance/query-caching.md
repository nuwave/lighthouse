# Query caching

In order to speed up GraphQL query parsing, the parsed queries can be stored in the Laravel cache.

## Configuration

Query caching is enabled by default.
You can disable it by setting `query_cache.enable` to `false` in `config/lighthouse.php`.

You can control how query caching works through the option `query_cache.mode` in `config/lighthouse.php`.
Make sure to [clear the query cache](#cache-invalidation) when changing the mode.

### Mode `store`

Use an external shared cache through a Laravel cache store like Redis or Memcached.
This is only recommended if your application can not write to the local filesystem.

### Mode `opcache`

Store parsed queries in PHP files on the local filesystem to leverage OPcache.
This is recommended if your application is running on a single server instance with write access to a persistent local filesystem.

### Mode `hybrid`

Leverage OPcache, but use a shared cache store when local files are not found.
This is recommended if your application is running on multiple server instances with write access to a persistent local filesystem.

## Cache invalidation

You may set the option `query_cache.ttl` in `config/lighthouse.php` to remove cache entries automatically after a given number of seconds.
This is only supported when using an external shared cache through a Laravel cache store like Redis or Memcached.
That way, old queries that are potentially unused will be removed after a while.

When using the modes [`opcache`](#mode-opcache) or [`hybrid`](#mode-hybrid), you need to remove old cached query files manually.
For example, you may run the following command periodically to remove all cached query files older than 24 hours.

```shell
php artisan lighthouse:clear-query-cache --opcache-only --opcache-ttl-hours=24
```

In some scenarios, you may need to clear the query cache completely.

The Artisan command works based on your current configuration for `query_cache` in `config/lighthouse.php`.

- When using the modes [`store`](#mode-store) or [`hybrid`](#mode-hybrid), all entries in the configured cache store will be removed regardless of their age or whether they even belong to Lighthouse.
- When using the modes [`opcache`](#mode-opcache) or [`hybrid`](#mode-hybrid), all cached query files will be removed.

When you plan to change `query_cache.mode`, clear your cache while your current configuration is still in place.

```shell
php artisan lighthouse:clear-query-cache
```

Other reasons to clear the query cache completely include:

- you plan to upgrade the package `webonyx/graphql-php` to a new version that changes the internal representation of parsed queries
- you have stale queries in your cache that have an inappropriate or missing TTL
- you want to free up disk space used by cached query files

## Automated Persisted Queries

Lighthouse supports Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ), compatible with the
[Apollo implementation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq).

APQ is enabled by default, but depends on query caching being enabled.

## Query validation caching

Lighthouse can cache the result of the query validation process as well.
It only caches queries without errors.
`QueryComplexity` validation can not be cached as it is dependent on the query, so it is always executed.

Query validation caching is disabled by default.
You can enable it by setting `validation_cache.enable` to `true` in `config/lighthouse.php`.

## Testing caveats

If you are mocking Laravel cache classes like `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache` or `Illuminate\Cache\Repository` and asserting expectations in your unit tests, it might be best to disable the query cache in your `phpunit.xml`:

```diff
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <phpunit ...>
      ...
      <php>
+         <server name="LIGHTHOUSE_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLE" value="false" />
      </php>
  </phpunit>
```
