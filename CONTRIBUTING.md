# How to contribute to Lighthouse

Thank you for contributing to Lighthouse. Here are some tips to make this easy for you.

## The process

1. Fork the project
1. Create a new branch
1. Code, commit and push
1. Open a pull request detailing your changes. Make sure to follow the [template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

## Setup

The project setup is based upon [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
For convenience, common tasks are wrapped up in the [Makefile](Makefile) for usage with [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

Just clone the project and run the following in the project root:

    make setup
    make

To see the available commands, run:

    make help

## Testing

We use **PHPUnit** for unit tests and integration tests.

Have a new feature? You can start off by writing some tests that detail
the behaviour you want to achieve and go from there.

Fixing a bug? The best way to ensure it is fixed for good and never comes
back is to write a failing test for it and then make it pass. If you cannot
figure out how to fix it yourself, feel free to submit a PR with a failing test.

Here is how to set up Xdebug in PhpStorm https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-xdebug.html

> Enabling Xdebug slows down tests by an order of magnitude.
> Stop listening for Debug Connection to speed it back up.

Set the environment variable `XDEBUG_REMOTE_HOST` to the IP of your host machine as
seen from the Docker container. This may differ based on your setup: When running
Docker for Desktop, it is usually `10.0.2.2`, when running from a VM it is something else.

## Documentation

The documentation for Lighthouse is located in [`/docs`](/docs).
You can check out the [Docs README](/docs/.github/README.md) for more information on how to contribute to the docs.

## Changelog

We keep a [changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) to inform users about changes in our releases.

When you change something notable, add it to the top of the file in the `Unreleased` section.

Choose the appropriate type for your change:

- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

Then, add a short description of your change and close it off with a link to your PR.

## Code guidelines

### Laravel feature usage

We strive to be compatible with both Lumen and Laravel.

Do not use Facades and utilize dependency injection instead.
Not every application has them enabled - Lumen does not use Facades by default.

Prefer direct usage of Illuminate classes instead of helpers.

```php
// Correct usage
use \Illuminate\Support\Arr;
Arr::get($foo, 'bar');

// Wrong usage
array_get($foo, 'bar');
```

A notable exception is the `response()` helper - using DI for injecting a
`ResponseFactory` does not work in Lumen, while `response()` works for both.

### Type definitions

Prefer the strictest possible type annotations wherever possible.
If known, add additional type information in the PHPDoc.

```php
/**
 * We know we get an array of strings here.
 *
 * @param  string[]  $bar
 * @return string
 */
function foo(array $bar): string
```

For aggregate types such as the commonly used `Collection` class, use
the generic type hint style. While not officially part of PHPDoc, it is understood
by PhpStorm and most other editors.

```php
/**
 * Hint at the contents of the Collection.
 *
 * @return \Illuminate\Support\Collection<string>
 */
function foo(): Collection
```

Use `self` to annotate that a class returns an instance of itself (or its child).
Use [PHPDoc type hints](http://docs.phpdoc.org/guides/types.html#keywords) to
differentiate between cases where you return the original object instance and
other cases where you instantiate a new class.

```php
<?php

class Foo
{
    /**
     * Some attribute.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $bar;

    /**
     * Use $this for fluent setters when we expect the exact same object back.
     *
     * @param  string  $bar
     * @return $this
     */
    public function setBar(string $bar): self
    {
        $this->bar = $bar;

        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * Use static when you return a new instance.
     *
     * @return static
     */
    public function duplicate(): self
    {
        $instance = new static;
        $instance->bar = $this->bar;

        return $instance;
    }
}
```

### Annotating Exception Throwing

Only annotate `@throws` for Exceptions that are thrown in the function itself.

```php
/**
 * @throws \Exception
 */
function foo(){
  throw Excection();
}

/**
 * No need to annotate the Exception here, even though
 * it is thrown indirectly.
 */
function bar(){
  foo();
}
```

## Code style

We use [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) to ensure clean formatting, oriented
at the Laravel coding style.

Look through some code to get a feel for the naming conventions.

Prefer explicit naming and short, focused functions over excessive comments.

### Ternarys

Ternary's should be spread out across multiple lines.

```php
$foo = $cond
    ? 1
    : 2;
```

### Class References

When used in the actual source code, classes must always be imported at the top.
Class references in PHPDoc must use the full namespace.

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Foo
{
    /**
     * @var \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
     */
    protected $model;

    public function bar(): Model
    {
        return $this->model;
    }
}
```

You can use the following two case-sensitive regexes to search for violations:

```regexp
@(var|param|return|throws).*\|[A-Z]
@(var|param|return|throws)\s*[A-Z]
```

## Benchmarks

We use [phpbench](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench) for running benchmarks
on performance critical pieces of code.

Run the reports that are defined in `phpbench.json` via the command line,
for example:

    vendor/bin/phpbench run --report=ast
