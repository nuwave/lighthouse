This repository and the issue tracker are used to advance the development of Lighthouse.
Issues that are neither detailed bug reports nor well-thought-out feature proposals will be closed.

You can use the following channels to ask support questions:

- [Use the laravel-lighthouse tag on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/laravel-lighthouse)
- [Hop into Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/lighthouse-php/shared_invite/https://join.slack.com/t/lighthouse-php/shared_invite/zt-4sm280w1-wu21r94f3kLRRtBXRbXVfw)
