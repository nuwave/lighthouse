You can use the following channels to ask support questions:
- [Use the laravel-lighthouse tag on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/laravel-lighthouse) 
- [Hop into Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/lighthouse-php/shared_invite/enQtMzc1NzQwNTUxMjk3LWMyZWRiNWFmZGUxZmRlNDJkMTQ2ZDA1NzQ1YjVkNTdmNWE1OTUyZjZiN2I2ZGQxNTNiZTZiY2JlNmY2MGUyNTQ)
