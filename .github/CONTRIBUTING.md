# How to contribute to Lighthouse

Hey, thank you for contributing to Lighthouse. Here are some tips to make
it easy for you.

## Testing

We use **PHPUnit** for unit tests and integration tests.

Have a new feature? You can start off by writing some tests that detail
the behaviour you want to achieve and go from there.

Fixing a bug? The best way to ensure it is fixed for good and never comes
back is to write a failing test for it and then make it pass. If you can
not figure out how to fix it yourself, feel free to submit a PR with a
failing test.

To run the tests locally, you can use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
Just clone the project and run the following in the project root:

    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec php bash
    composer install
    composer test

If you want to use Xdebug, you can enter that container instead:

    docker-compose exec xdebug bash

Here is how to set up Xdebug in PhpStorm https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-xdebug.html

## Committing code

1. Fork the project
1. Create a new branch
1. Think about how the changes you are about to make can be tested, write tests before coding 
1. Run tests, make sure they fail
1. Write the actual code to make the tests pass
1. Commit with a concise title line and a few more lines detailing the change
1. Open a pull request detailing your changes. Make sure to follow the [template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

## Code guidelines

### Laravel feature usage

We strive to be compatible with both Lumen and Laravel.

Do not use Facades and utilize dependency injection instead.
Not every application has them enabled - Lumen does not use Facades by default.

Prefer direct usage of Illuminate classes instead of helpers.

```php
// Correct usage
use \Illuminate\Support\Arr;
Arr::get($foo, 'bar');

// Wrong usage
array_get($foo, 'bar');
```

A notable exception is the `response()` helper - using DI for injecting a
`ResponseFactory` does not work in Lumen, while `response()` works for both.

### Type definitions

Prefer the strictest possible type annotations wherever possible.
If known, add additional type information in the PHPDoc.

```php
/**
 * We know we get an array of strings here.
 *
 * @param  string[]  $bar
 * @return string
 */
function foo(array $bar): string
```

For aggregate types such as the commonly used `Collection` class, use
the generic type hint style. While not officially part of PHPDoc, it is understood
by PhpStorm and most other editors.

```php
/**
 * Hint at the contents of the Collection.
 *
 * @return \Illuminate\Support\Collection<string>
 */
function foo(): Collection
```

Use `self` to annotate that a class returns an instance of itself (or its child).
Use [PHPDoc type hints](http://docs.phpdoc.org/guides/types.html#keywords) to
differentiate between cases where you return the original object instance and
other cases where you instantiate a new class.

```php
<?php

class Foo
{
    /**
     * Some attribute.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $bar;
    
    /**
     * Use $this for fluent setters when we expect the exact same object back. 
     *
     * @param  string  $bar
     * @return $this
     */
    public function setBar(string $bar): self
    {
        $this->bar = $bar;

        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * Use static when you return a new instance.
     *
     * @return static
     */
    public function duplicate(): self
    {
        $instance = new static;
        $instance->bar = $this->bar;

        return $instance;
    }
}
```

### Annotating Exception Throwing

Only annotate `@throws` for Exceptions that are thrown in the function itself.

```php
/**
 * @throws \Exception
 */
function foo(){
  throw Excection();
}

/**
 * No need to annotate the Exception here, even though
 * it is thrown indirectly. 
 */
function bar(){
  foo();
}
```

## Code style

We use [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) to ensure clean formatting, oriented
at the Laravel coding style.

Look through some of the code to get a feel for the naming conventions.

Prefer explicit naming and short functions over excessive comments.

### Ternarys

Ternary's should be spread out across multiple lines.

```php
$foo = $cond
    ? 1
    : 2;
```

### new + braces

If no arguments are passed to a class constructor, omit the braces.

```php
new Foo        // correct
new Foo('bar') // correct
new Foo()      // wrong
```

### Class References

When used in the actual source code, classes must always be imported at the top.
However, class references in PHPDoc must use the full namespace.

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

interface Foo
{
    /**
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
     */
    public function bar(): Model;
}
```

You can use the following two case-sensitive regexes to search for violations:

```regexp
@(var|param|return|throws).*\|[A-Z]
@(var|param|return|throws)\s*[A-Z]
```

## Documentation

The docs for Lighthouse are located in [`/docs`](/docs).
You can check out the [Docs README](/docs/.github/README.md) for more information on how to to contribute to the docs.

We keep a [changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) to inform users about changes in our releases.
